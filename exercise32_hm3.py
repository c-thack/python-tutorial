#  Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:
#
# Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
# Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, donâ€™t penalize them -
# let them guess again.
# Optional additions:
#
# When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game. (done)
# Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman. (zzz)
