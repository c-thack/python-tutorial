# Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
# (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a
# divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

        print(x)  # or make/append to a new list and print it at the end
